        <p><strong>Javascript</strong> was initially created to “make web pages come alive”.</p>
        <p>
          It was developed by <strong>Brenden Eich</strong> in 1995. He was a
          Netscape Communications Corporation programmer & it took only 10 days
          to create it & was named
          <em>Mocha.</em>
          Later the name got changed to <em>Livescript</em> and then finally to
          <em>JavaScript</em>
          as we know it today.
        </p>
        <p>
          The popularity of JavaScript grew & in the year 1996 it was handed
          over to the international standards scripting language body called
          <strong>ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association)</strong>,
          which is responsible for the development and upkeep of the language to
          this day.
        </p>
        <p>
          JavaScript was used to add programs to web pages in the browser. The
          language was adopted by all other major web browsers. Since then it
          has made modern web applications possible—applications with which you
          can interact directly without doing a page reload for every action.
        </p>
        <h3 class="ulheading">
          Here we will be discussing about the data types used in javascript-
        </h3>
        <p>It is broadly classified in to Primitive and Advanced data types.</p>
        <div>
          <h4>Primitive data types</h4>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <em>String</em> - A sequence of characters that represent a text
              value within quotes. For e.g: "Hello!".
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Number</em> - An integer or floating point number. For e.g: 42
              or 3.14159.
            </li>
            <li><em>Boolean</em> - true and false.</li>
            <li>
              <em>undefined</em> - If a variable is only declared & no value is
              assigned then it will show as undefined.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Null</em> - A special keyword denoting a null value, here we
              assign as null or no value.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Advanced data types</h4>
          <ul class="list">
            <li>
              <em>Objects</em> - Objects are used to store collections of data
              and more complex entities.
            </li>
            <li>
              <em>Symbols</em> - The symbol type is used to create unique
              identifiers for objects.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="String">
        <header class="string">
          <h2>String</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          A <strong>String</strong> in JavaScript is any letter, word or sentences.
        </p><br>
        <p>They must be written within quotes.</p>
        <p>
          let str = "Hello";
        </p>
        <p>
          let str2 = 'Single quotes are ok too';
        </p>
        <p>
          let phrase = `can embed another ${str}`;
        </p>
        </p>
        <p>In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
        </p>
        <code>
            Double quotes: "Hello".<br>
            Single quotes: 'Hello'.<br>
            Backticks: `Hello`.
          </code>
        <p>
          <strong>Double</strong> and <strong>single</strong> quotes are “simple” quotes. There’s practically no
          difference between them in JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Backticks</strong> are “extended functionality” quotes. They allow us to embed variables and
          expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${…}, for example:
        </p>
        <code>
              alert( `Hello, ${name}!` ); //the result is: Hello, John!
            </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Numbers">
        <header class="numbers">
          <h2>Numbers</h2>
        </header>
        <p>In Javascript <strong>Numbers</strong> are any number- whole or decimal.</p>
        <p>In modern JavaScript, there are two types of numbers:<em>Regular & BigInt.</em></p>
        <p>
          The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          <strong>Regular numbers</strong> in JavaScript are stored in 64-bit format IEEE-754, also known as “double
          precision floating point numbers”. These are numbers that we’re using most of the time, and we’ll talk about
          them in this chapter.
        </p>
        <p>for e.g:</p>
        <code>
          let n = 123;
          n = 12.345;
        </code>
        <p>There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so
          on.</p>
        <p><strong>BigInt numbers</strong>, to represent integers of arbitrary length. They are sometimes needed,
          because a regular number can’t exceed 253 or be less than -253. As bigints are used in few special areas, we
          devote them a special chapter BigInt.</p>
        <p>BigInt type was recently added to the language to represent integers of arbitrary length.
        </p>
        <p>A BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:</p>
        <code>
            // the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
            const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;
          </code>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Boolean">
        <header class="boolean">
          <h2>Boolean</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The boolean type has only two values: <strong>true</strong> and <strong>false</strong>
        </p>
        <p>This type is commonly used to store yes/no values: true means “yes, correct”, and false means “no,
          incorrect”.</p>
        <p>For instance:</p>
        <code>let nameFieldChecked = true; // yes, name field is checked<br>
          let ageFieldChecked = false; // no, age field is not checked</code><br>
        <p>Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:</p>
        <code>
            let isGreater = 4 > 1;

            alert( isGreater ); // true (the comparison result is "yes")
          </code><br>
        <p>In JavaScript, the operator is a little bit trickier and more powerful. But first, let’s see what happens
          with boolean values.</p>
        <p>There are four possible logical combinations:</p>
        <code>alert( true || true );   // true<br>
            alert( false || true );  // true<br>
            alert( true || false );  // true<br>
            alert( false || false ); // false</code>
      </section><br><br><br>
      <section class="main-section" id="Undefined">
        <header class="undefined">
          <h2>Undefined</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          The meaning of <strong>Undefined</strong> is “value is not assigned”.
        </p>
        <p>If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then its value is undefined:</p>
        <code>let age;

          alert(age); // shows "undefined"</code>
        <p>Technically, it is possible to explicitly assign undefined to a variable:</p>
        <code>let age = 100;

            // change the value to undefined
            age = undefined;
            
            alert(age); // "undefined"</code><br>
        <p>undefined means “no value.” Uninitialized variables are undefined:</p>
        <code>> var foo;
              > foo
              undefined</code><br>
        <p>Missing parameters are undefined:</p>
        <code>> function f(x) { return x }
                > f()
                undefined</code><br>
        <p>If you read a nonexistent property, you get undefined:</p>
        <code>> var obj = {}; // empty object
                  > obj.foo
                  undefined</code>
        <p>…But we don’t recommend doing that. Normally, one uses null to assign an “empty” or “unknown” value to a
          variable, while undefined is reserved as a default initial value for unassigned things.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Null">
        <header class="null">
          <h2>Null</h2>
        </header>
        <p><strong>Null</strong> means “no object.” It is used as a nonvalue whenever an object is expected.</p>
        <p>The special
          null value does not belong to any of the types described above.</p>
        <p>It forms a separate type of its own which contains only the null value:</p>
        <code>let age = null;</code>
        <p>In JavaScript, null is not a “reference to a non-existing object” or a “null pointer” like in some other
          languages.</p>
        <p>It’s just a special value which represents “nothing”, “empty” or “value unknown”.</p>
        <p>The code above states that age is unknown.</p>
        <code>typeof null // "object"  (2)</code>
        <p>The result of typeof null is "object". That’s an officially recognized error in typeof behavior, coming from
          the early days of JavaScript and kept for compatibility. Definitely, null is not an object. It is a special
          value with a separate type of its own.</p>

User Story #1: I can see a main element with a corresponding id="main-doc", which contains the page's main content (technical documentation).

User Story #2: Within the #main-doc element, I can see several section elements, each with a class of main-section. There should be a minimum of 5.

User Story #3: The first element within each .main-section should be a header element which contains text that describes the topic of that section.

User Story #4: Each section element with the class of main-section should also have an id that corresponds with the text of each header contained within it. 
Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding id="JavaScript_and_Java").

User Story #5: The .main-section elements should contain at least 10 p elements total (not each).

User Story #6: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 code elements total (not each).

User Story #7: The .main-section elements should contain at least 5 li items total (not each).

User Story #8: I can see a nav element with a corresponding id="navbar".

User Story #9: The navbar element should contain one header element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation.

User Story #10: Additionally, the navbar should contain link (a) elements with the class of nav-link. There should be one for every element with the class main-section.

User Story #11: The header element in the navbar must come before any link (a) elements in the navbar.

User Story #12: Each element with the class of nav-link should contain text that corresponds to the header text within each section (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world").

User Story #13: When I click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the main-doc element (e.g. If I click on a nav-link element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a section element that has that id and contains the corresponding header.

User Story #14: On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with id="navbar" should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user.

User Story #15: My Technical Documentation page should use at least one media query.
